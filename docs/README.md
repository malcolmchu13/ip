# Rat

> A lightweight JavaFX task assistant that understands natural, chat-style commands. Add todos, deadlines, and events; list, mark, unmark, delete, find, and now snooze tasks without leaving the keyboard.

## Quick Start

Requirements

- Java 17 or later installed locally
- (Optional) Gradle â€” the project includes a wrapper so `./gradlew` works out of the box

**Run**

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Rat opens in a JavaFX window. All tasks are persisted automatically to `./data/Rat.txt` after each change.

## Adding Tasks

### Todos

```
todo finish homework
```

```
Got it. I've added this task:
  [T][ ] finish homework
Now you have 1 task in the list.
```

### Deadlines

```
deadline Submit report /by 2024-10-05 1800
```

```
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] Submit report (by: Oct 05 2024 06:00 PM)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

Accepted date/time formats include `yyyy-MM-dd`, `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`, `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm`, and ISO strings like `2024-10-05T18:00`.

### Events

```
event Team sync /from 2024-10-05 1400 /to 2024-10-05 1530
```

```
Got it. I've added this task:
  [E][ ] Team sync (from: Oct 05 2024 02:00 PM to: Oct 05 2024 03:30 PM)
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
```

## Snoozing Tasks

Use `snooze` to reschedule deadlines and events without recreating them.

Deadline example:

```
snooze 2 /by 2024-10-06 0900
```

Event example:

```
snooze 3 /from 2024-10-06 1400 /to 2024-10-06 1600
```

Both commands update the existing task and immediately persist the change.
